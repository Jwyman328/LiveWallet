# TODO frontend
- better control where wallets are saved and imported from so it is less random. like how sparrow does it
- use mantine notifications for when there are network failures
- improve the readme.md
- Componentize a bit more 
- write tests for frontend
- add typing for all api responses
- remove all any typing.
- add a banner for showing that a specific wallet is loaded
- clear the loaded wallet configs when any of the form values have changed



# TODOs backend
- add mypy
- add a pyproject.toml to manage ruff line length stuff so that ruff formatting is inline with the lsp?
- Also set the default custom fee rate to the current rate 

# TODOs build
- use a random port to run the backend on 
- build for not just macOS? 
  - https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/FAQ#features
  - "Since pyinstaller is not a cross-compiler (which means with pyinstaller you cannot create an executable for any other system than the one you are on), you will have to look for other tools."
- use wine?
- Analyze the build size and try to make it smaller
- set up github test runner on commit

# TODOS hosting site
- make website to host bundle and allow download





# Feature Ideas
- ability to just put in a utxo and test that instead of an entire wallet.
- click on a utxo and get told when it is unspendable.


# Open questions 
- Different image / design on sign in page?
