TODO
- Fix the Estimate batch tx button size. 
  - have it line up with output box size?
- Componentize a bit more 
- remove the default descriptor
- change the login page to not just be a textbox descriptor but to have it more like sparrow where you put in the components that build up the descriptor
- fix the styles for batch button / fee display, they are slightly off.
