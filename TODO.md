TODO
- only start the backend from electron in prod
- better errors when I can't connect to the electrum servers (public or private)
- Fix the readme to be about my project.
- switch defaults for product deployment
- Fix the Estimate batch tx button size. 
  - have it line up with output box size?
- Componentize a bit more 
- remove the default descriptor
- change the login page to not just be a textbox descriptor but to have it more like sparrow where you put in the components that build up the descriptor
- fix the styles for batch button / fee display, they are slightly off.

- get the app build executable to have a fitting icon
- do I need to wait at all in main.ts for the child process flask?

notes
- to build I must do 
$ sudo npm run package
